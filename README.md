"The fridge remembers everything, so you don't have to. Just make sure to save your game."

"Don't forget to save your progress. You don't want to lose everything you've worked for."

"Saving your game is like saving a piece of your life."

"You know what's worse than finding spider webs in your fridge? Forgetting why you opened it in the first place. That's when you forget things, my friend."
